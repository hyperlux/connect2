# Auroville Connect Deployment Status Report

## Overview
The Auroville Connect application has been successfully deployed to auroville.social. The application is accessible and functioning as expected.

## Deployment Actions Completed

### Infrastructure Setup
- Server access and domain verification confirmed
- Required software installed (Node.js, Git, PostgreSQL, Nginx, Certbot)
- SSL certificates configured for secure HTTPS access

### Deployment Process
- Deployment script customized with correct parameters
- Application files deployed to `/var/www/html/AurovilleConnect/`
- Frontend built and backend configured
- Database created and migrations applied
- Services configured and started

### Configuration Updates
- Fixed Nginx configuration to point to the correct directory (dist instead of public)
- Updated database connection string with proper credentials
- Configured systemd service for automatic startup

### Post-Deployment Tasks
- Created admin user (admin@auroville.social / SecurePassword123)
- Set up daily database backups at 2 AM
- Configured log rotation for deployment logs
- Updated deployment checklist with completed items

## Current Status
- Frontend: Accessible at https://auroville.social
- API: Accessible at https://api.auroville.social
- Services: All services (Nginx, PostgreSQL, application) running correctly

## Issues Encountered and Resolved
1. **403 Forbidden Error**
   - Issue: Nginx was configured to serve files from the wrong directory
   - Solution: Updated Nginx configuration to point to the correct directory (dist instead of public)

2. **Admin User Creation Error**
   - Issue: Environment variables not loading correctly in the create-admin.js script
   - Solution: Created a wrapper script with dotenv to properly load environment variables

3. **API Connection Error**
   - Issue: Backend server was only listening on localhost (127.0.0.1) instead of all interfaces
   - Solution: Modified server/index.js to listen on all interfaces (0.0.0.0)

4. **SSL Certificate Error**
   - Issue: SSL certificate for api.auroville.social didn't include the domain as a Subject Alternative Name
   - Solution: Renewed the certificate to include both auroville.social and api.auroville.social domains

5. **Login CORS Error**
   - Issue: CORS configuration in both server/index.js and nginx.conf was incorrectly setting multiple origins in a single Access-Control-Allow-Origin header
   - Solution: Updated CORS configuration to dynamically set the header based on the request origin
   - Implementation: Created a comprehensive fix script (fix-cors-issue.sh) that:
     * Removes duplicate CORS middleware in server/index.js
     * Implements a proper dynamic CORS origin function
     * Updates Nginx configuration to pass through headers set by the backend
     * Rebuilds the frontend with correct environment variables

6. **API URL Configuration Issue**
   - Issue: Service worker had a hardcoded localhost API URL, causing frontend requests to be directed to localhost instead of the production API
   - Solution: Updated service worker to use the production API URL and created a fix script to ensure proper rebuilding of the frontend

7. **Email Verification Issue**
   - Issue: Email verification emails are not being sent during user registration
   - Status: Identified but not yet resolved
   - Next Steps: Investigate email service configuration and SMTP settings

## Remaining Tasks
- Fix email verification functionality for user registration
- Complete testing of basic functionality (forum posts, events calendar)
- Set up additional security measures (firewall, fail2ban)
- Configure comprehensive monitoring
- Set up regular security audits

## Conclusion
The deployment of Auroville Connect to auroville.social has been completed successfully. The application is operational and accessible to users. Post-deployment tasks have been completed to ensure proper maintenance and security of the application.
